                maintain your account, to provide you with Services, comply with
                legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce other applicable
                contracts and policies.

                  Depending on where you reside, you may have a right to opt out
                  of the "sale" or "share" of your personal information or to
                  opt out of the processing of your personal information for
                  purposes considered to be "targeted advertising", as defined

                  website with the Global Privacy Control opt-out preference
                  signal enabled, depending on where you are, we will
                  automatically treat this as a request to opt-out for the
                  device and browser that you use to visit the website. If we
                  are able to associate the device sending the signal to a
                  Shopify account, we will apply the opt out request to the
                  account as well. To learn more about Global Privacy Control,
                  you can visit https://globalprivacycontrol.org/. Other than
                  the Global Privacy Control, we do not recognize other "Do Not
                  Track" signals that may be sent from your web browser or

                process your requests, as permitted or required under applicable
                law. In accordance with applicable laws, you may designate an
                authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise
                your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we
                will require that the agent provide proof you have authorized
                them to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your
                identity directly with us. We will respond to your request in a
